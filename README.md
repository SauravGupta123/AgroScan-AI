# Leaf Disease Detection using Deep Learning

<!-- ![Demo](https://github.com/shukur-alom/leaf-diseases-detect/blob/main/Media/website.gif) -->

This project is a leaf disease detection system that uses deep learning techniques, including transfer learning, to identify and classify 33 different types of leaf diseases. The model has been trained on a large dataset of images and is designed to help agricultural professionals and enthusiasts diagnose plant diseases in a fast and accurate manner.
